An application to simplify pendulum equations for programmers writing mechanical models

Computer programs that simulate the motion of objects will often require complex mechanics knowledge which programmers may not always have. One such complex mechanics problem is a pendulum.
Many equations are required to simulate different pendulum based scenarios. They are not all easily accessible from the internet, particularly without some mathematical understanding.
This project will assess the existing methods for dealing with pendulum conundrums and produce a computing-based solution to help programmers understand the mathematical equations behind a pendulum.
